# AliPhysics
ALICE Analysis Repository

The repo provides different code for Physics Analysis work during my PhD. My PhD was based on the data analysis of particle physics data generated at LHC, CERN. The codes present in the repository provides the algorithms required for the detection of particle (kaon, in my case) for certain momentum range and centrality.
